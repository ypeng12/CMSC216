Also known as the Pichiciego, the pink fairy armadillo is the smallest known
species of armadillo.  It lives in the sandy plains and dry grasslands of
central Argentina and other parts of South America.  Unique adaptations like
an aerodynamic body shape, smooth dorsal shell, and sharp claws mean this
creature is able to completely bury itself in sand in a matter of seconds
and then nagivate underground with ease.  Similar to a mole, the pink fairy
armadillo will spend the vast majority of its life underground.  It is also
nocturnal, only emerging ocassionally at night to find food.

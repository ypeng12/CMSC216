Researchers at Cambridge University discovered that sheep prefer to go
through doors with a picture of a smiling human over a door with a picture
of an angry human.

Sheep can remember the faces of up to 50 other sheep as well as their
shepherd.

Sheared sheep don't recognize each other and fight for a few days to
re-establish a hierarchy.

In the Falkland Islands, sheep outnumber humans at a ratio of 350:1.

The Venezuelan poodle moth is a moth photographed in 2009 by Dr. Arthur
Anker of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, in the Gran Sabana region of Venezuela.
Experts agree it most likely belongs to the lepidopteran genus Artace, but
the one existing photo does not show sufficient detail to determine whether
it belongs to a described species or one new to science.  The moth is often
confused online with images of other furry moths, such as Bombyx mori.

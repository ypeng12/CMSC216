/* Writing good descriptive comments is very important. */

/* This is not only because comments are a significant part of your score. */

/* It is also because writing good descriptive comments help you understand
   you own program much better, and often the process of writing comments
   to describe what your code is doing makes you realize that you need to
   fix or change something in it. */

/* So write more comments today! */
